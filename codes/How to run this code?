I know there is alot of files and codes :P
You need to run defines first before running the player.
Copy those Define text files(you can simply copy with ctrl+a) and paste to different buffers in Sonic Pi.
Also you have to copy those 6 define text files named lefthand and righthand to different buffers.
Finally copy and paste last file named Unravel-Player to different buffer.
Run those define codes one by one.
Now you can run the player and listen. :3
